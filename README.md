# Multithreading
This project is a multithreaded program that simulates training of machines using CPUs and GPUs.
We implement a simple Micro-Service framework, which use to implement a system for managing the University
compute resources.
This project is composed of two main sections:
1. Building a simple Micro-Service framework.
2. Implementing a system for managing the university computer resources on top of
this framework.
